# Pseudo-Class
A `pseudo-class` is a keyword that can be added to *selectors*, in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the `:hover` pseudo-class selector. 
Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:
```css
a:hover {
  color: red;
}
```
