# Inline CSS
This is one of the three ways to insert a style sheet. 

This is used to apply a unique style to an element.

To use inline styles, add the *style* attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

```html
<h1 style="color:blue; margin-left: 30px;"> This is a heading </h1>
```

**Tip**: Inline style doesn't have many of the advantages of an external or internal style sheet (by mixing content with presentation).
Use this only in rare cases.
