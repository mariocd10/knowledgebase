# Selectors
The selector points to the HTML element that the style will be applied to. They can be used to find or select elements based on their element
name, id, class, attribute, and more.

## The Element Selector
The element selector is based on the element's name.
```css
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
  }
```
## Attribute Selector
The selector matches and styles elements with a specific attribute value.

### Example
```css
[type='radio'] {
  margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
}
```
