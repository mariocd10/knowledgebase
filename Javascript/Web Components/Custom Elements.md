# Custom Elements
With **Custom Elements**, web developers can **create their own HTML elements**, **modify existing ones** or **add on functionality**
to custom elements made by others. The *API* is the foundation of web components and being a web-standard, makes it easier
for developers to create reusable components with nothing more than vanilla JS/HTML/CSS. 

Custom Elements are the modernization of HTML, bundling structure with behavior. They teach the browser new tricks while preserving
the benefits of HTML.
