# Forms
Building web forms lets you submit data to a server using pure HTML. You can do this by specifying the action on the `form` element.

```html
<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>
```
## &lt;form> Element

## &lt;input> Element
The `<input>` element is the most important form element. It can be displayed in many ways depending on the **type** attribute.

Type | Description
--- | ---
&lt;input type="text"> | One-line text field
&lt;input type="radio"> | Radio Button
&lt;input type="submit"> | Submit Button (submit form)
