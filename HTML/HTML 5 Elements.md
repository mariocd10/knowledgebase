# HTML 5 Elements
HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags.
* main
* header
* footer
* nav
* video
* article
* section
* ... many more

These tags make HTML easier to read, and also help with SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and accessibility. 

## <main>
The *main* tag helps search engines and other devs find the main content of your page.
